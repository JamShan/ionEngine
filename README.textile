h1. ionEngine

h2. Overview

ionEngine is an application framework written in C++ designed primarily for use
in game development and other graphics-heavy applications.

It is designed with maximum extensibility in mind to enable rapid prototyping
while allowing thorough customization where needed. The goal is to provide a
framework that lasts through the early stages of development through to
production and release.

ionEngine is built using modern OpenGL practices for simple and direct
cross-system compatibility and optimal performance.

h2. Features

ionEngine provides features through a large number of optional modules so
that only the necessary components need to be included in a project.

Features included in ionEngine or additional modules are:

* Component-entity based scene graph which is renderer-agnostic to maximize extendability
* Forward and deferred lighting systems implemented using OpenGL
* Bloom, SSAO, depth-of-field, and other post-processing effects
* Volumetric utilities such as a shader-based raycast volume renderer and marching cubes implementation
* GUI elements provided through GWEN
* Windowing and input provided through GLFW
