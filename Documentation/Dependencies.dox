\page dependencies Dependencies

ionEngine depends on the following external libraries:

- stb_image [Header-only]
- glm [Header-only]
- glew
- glfw
- freetype
- GWEN

The easiest way to acquire these dependencies is to clone the [ionEngine SDKs respository][sdks]
which contains pre-built binaries for Windows x64 platforms. Visual Studio 2013 project files are included for Windows builds
on alternate platforms.
