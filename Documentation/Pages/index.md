=========

Welcome to ionEngine's documentation!

Overview
--------

ionEngine is a C++ 3D application engine that aims to provide the utility of a game engine without raising the level of abstraction at which developers work.

ionEngine is divided into a number of modules. Each module is a collection of classes, functions, and
types which may be dependant on other modules and is typically contained within a single namespace. For more
on modules, see the [modules overview page](@ref modules_overview) or [the modules reference list](modules.html).


Getting Started
---------------

ionEngine relies on a number of [dependencies](@ref dependencies).
For instructions on how to build and install, see the [installation](@ref installation).
